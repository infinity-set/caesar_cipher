 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https:www.google.com)

<h2>Description</h2>
This Python program offers a straightforward way to encrypt or decrypt a secret message using a customizable key. 
The program employs a simple substitution cipher technique, which substitutes each character in the message with another character determined by the provided key. 
The encrypted or decrypted message is then presented on the screen and conveniently copied to the clipboard for easy sharing.
